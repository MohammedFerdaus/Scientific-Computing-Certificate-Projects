# Scientific Computing with Python - FreeCodeCamp Projects

This repository contains the five projects required for the Scientific Computing with Python Certification from [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). These projects demonstrate a strong foundation in Python programming through practical applications such as arithmetic formatting, time calculations, budgeting, geometric computations, and probability simulations. The goal of this collection is to showcase essential programming skills like problem-solving, data manipulation, and the use of object-oriented principles, all of which are fundamental for scientific and technical computing.

Projects Included

Arithmetic Formatter  
Formats arithmetic problems vertically and side-by-side, with an option to display answers.

Time Calculator  
Adds time durations while handling AM/PM notation, day changes, and returning the correct formatted result.

Budget App  
A simple budget tracking application that supports deposits, withdrawals, transfers, and generates a text-based spending chart.

Polygon Area Calculator  
Uses object-oriented programming to create classes for shapes like rectangles and squares, and calculates area, perimeter, and diagonal length.

Probability Calculator  
Simulates probability experiments by drawing items from a hat multiple times and estimating the likelihood of certain outcomes.
